# Load_and_Assess_Data
LiveProject NYC AirBNB Deep Learning

Welcome to the liveProject: End-to-End Deep Learning for Price Prediction. This is part 1: Prepare Tabular Data. In this project and its related projects (part 2: Train a DL Model, and part 3: Deploy a DL Model), you fill the role of a data scientist working for the Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) in New York City. The OSE is responsible for monitoring the impact of short-term rentals in the city. To get a better handle on the impact of Airbnb listings in New York, the OSE needs to be able to assess the expected prices that will be charged for these listings.
